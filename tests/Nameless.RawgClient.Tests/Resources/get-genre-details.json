Generally, it describes any title developed by independent (thus the name) studio which means that game&#39;s launch was not powered with publisher&#39;s funds or any financial support other than crowdfunding. The genre is kickstarted mainly because of the variety of crowd-funding policies and many early-access platforms like Steam Greenlight. A corporation does not develop indies, so primarily the genre is associated with single developers or small studios. Lacking the budget, indie games are mostly shorter and lesser than their publisher-financed competitors. Such titles, therefore, bear no attachment to censorship regulations and can express whatever authors wish. It is worth to mention that a large portion of adult games is indie. The rules above can be applied to the most games; however, not all. Some titles may feature publisher, but it cannot affect the final product. Some specific examples of indie are World of Goo, Undertale, and Braid.</p>"}
